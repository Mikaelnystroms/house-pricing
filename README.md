# House Prices Prediction

This repository demonstrates how to predict house sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project is part of the **ML Engineering Zoomcamp** capstone and also takes part in the Kaggle competition **[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)**. Accurate price predictions are valuable for buyers, sellers, and agents, and this project provides an end-to-end solutionâ€”spanning exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

## Getting Started

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Training**
   - Start with `eda.ipynb` to explore the dataset and understand the feature engineering process. Easiest way to configure the environment is to use 'uv sync' to install the dependencies.
   - The notebook will guide you through training various models and selecting the best performing one
   - A simplified XGBoost model using 8 key features will be created for deployment, in the notebook the model is trained and saved as a BentoML model

2. **BentoML Setup & Deployment**
   - Create an account at [BentoML Cloud](https://cloud.bentoml.com)
   - Install the BentoML CLI and login:
     ```bash
     bentoml cloud login
     ```
   - Build and deploy the service:
     ```bash
     bentoml build
     bentoml deploy
     ```
   - Once deployed, you'll receive an endpoint URL for making predictions

3. **Testing the Deployed Model**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-endpoint-url/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "input_data": {
         "OverallQual": 7,
         "GrLivArea": 2000,
         "GarageCars": 2,
         "GarageArea": 400,
         "TotalBsmtSF": 1000,
         "FullBath": 2,
         "TotRmsAbvGrd": 8,
         "YearBuilt": 2000
       }
     }'
   ```
